        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The html is the framework for the webpage - it describes the structure, labelling different elements</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements indicate the role of their content and give structure to the content of the webpage</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, but is not visible to the user</li>
          <li>The meta element goes in the head and provides information to the browser about how the page will be rendered</li>
          <li>The head element can also contain other attributes, such as the language of the site, who made the site, and the title, which is important for SEO</li>
          <li>The body element contains the content that is visible to the user</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the language used to style an HTML document and describes how HTML elements should be displayed</li>
          <li>There are multiple ways to introduce CSS - inline, internal and external</li>
          <li>'Inline style' changes the attributes of a single element</li>
          <li>An 'internal style sheet' is embedded in the head, and contains rules for that webpage</li>
          <li>'External css style sheet' is the most common way to style a website - it keeps design rules together and makes changes easier. It is referenced with a link element in the HTML head</li>
          <li>There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing precise selection and styling of elements, some selectors include: type, class, ID and attribute selectors</li>
          <li>In a CSS sheet, styling elements applies to the entire page. Styling class attributes applies to specific parts of the page and can be done by creating a selector</li>
          <li>Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>Padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Working with git allows different developers to work on the same project concurrently - it allows version control and avoids conflicts or sync errors</li>
          <li>It is essential to work on new branches when making any changes to a project, they can then be checked and merged with the main branch without over-writing work</li>
          <li>Frequently sync the local version with the remote version in GitHub so a functional, updated version of the project can be shared and accessed by all team members</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b <i>new-branch-name</i>: creates a new branch and switches to it. Use conventions when naming, for example <i>feature/detail</i></li>
          <li>git add -A: adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area; the -A flag indicates we want to add all changes</li>
          <li>git commit -m "<i>description of commit</i>": creates a commit that captures the currently staged changes, ready to be pushed</li>
          <li>N.B. The convention is to write the description of a commit as an imperitive</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: use this before commiting, to check the local branch is in sync with the base branch - do this everytime you start to work</li>
          <li>git push origin <i>new-branch-name</i></li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Javascript adds interactivity to a static HTML/CSS page</li>
          <li>It is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and many many other things</li>
          <li>Basic JavaScript features include variables, strings and data types</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a JavaScript file</li>
          <li>Understanding control flow allows conditional logic to be added to the Prework Study Guide</li>
          <li>Arrays can be used to store data types in JavaScript, they can be thought of as how to store a group of related data in a variable</li>
          <li>A for loop can be used to operate on each element in an array</li>
          <li>Do not add your .js link to the header, it needs to load after the html so place it at the bottom of the body, before closing the tag</li>
          <li>JavaScript can store useful values inside variables</li>
          <li>It can perform operations on pieces of text (known as "strings")</li>
          <li>It can run a code in response to certain events</li>
          <li>Order really matters: the objects referenced have to exist before doing anything to them</li>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values, or put another way, it is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
          <li>One way to declare a variable is to use the var keyword followed by a unique name</li>
          <li>The equals sign is the assignment variable to assign specific data</li>
          <li>Quotation marks denote a string</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. For more than one condition, use else if</li>
          <li>Comments with line breaks have an asterisk and a forward slash; without line breaks two forward slashes can be used</li>
          <li>At the most basic level, a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task, they execute when called by name, unlike for loops and conditional statements, which automatically execute</li>
