          <li>Semantic HTML elements indicate the role of their content and give structure to the content of the webpage</li>
          <li>The html is the framework for the webpage - it describes the structure, labelling different elements</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, but is not visible to the user</li>
          <li>The meta element goes in the head and provides information to the browser about how the page will be rendered</li>
          <li>The head element can also contain other attributes, such as the language of the site, who made the site, and the title, which is important for SEO</li>
          <li>The body element contains the content that is visible to the user</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Working with git allows different developers to work on the same project concurrently</li>
          <li>It is essential to work on new branches when making any changes to a project, they can then be checked and merged with the main branch without over-writing work</li>
          <li>GitHub allows version control, concurrent working, and avoids conflicts or sync errors</li>
          <li>Frequently sync the local version with the remote version in GitHub so a functional, updated version of the project can be shared and accessed by all team members</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b <i>new-branch-name</i>: creates a new branch and switches to it. Use conventions when naming, for example <i>feature/detail</i></li>
          <li>git add -A: adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area; the -A flag indicates we want to add all changes</li>
          <li>git commit -m "<i>description of commit</i>": creates a commit that captures the currently staged changes, ready to be pushed</li>
          <li>N.B. The convention is to write the description of a commit as an imperitive</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: use this before commiting, to check the local branch is in sync with the base branch - do this everytime you start to work</li>
          <li>git push origin <i>new-branch-name</i></li>
